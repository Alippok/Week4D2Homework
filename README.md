# Week4D2Homework
Homework practising inner joins and many-many relationships
Found the inner joins a challenge but thats to be expected! Still not sure on what is actually happening in an inner join but have managed to create a join which brings back only pokemon objects from the Pokemons table who are owned. E.g. Onyx does not have an owner so is therefore not displayed.
